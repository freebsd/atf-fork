.Sh NAME
.Nm atf-lua
.Nd interpreter for lua-based test programs
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar script
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an interpreter that runs the test program given in
.Ar script
after loading the
.Xr atf-lua 3
library.
.Pp
.Nm
executes the interpreter, loads the
.Xr atf-lua 3
library and then runs the script.
You must consider
.Nm atf-lua
to be a stock Lua interpreter by default and thus should not use any
non-standard extensions.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Scripts using
.Xr atf-lua 3
should hardcode the path to
.Nm
in the script:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#! /path/to/bin/atf-lua
.Ed
